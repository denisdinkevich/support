### How do I add a list?

Please add your list [to this file](https://github.com/listcommunity/support/blob/master/src/lists.js)
and submit a pull request. Please follow this format and indentation:

```js
"sorrycc/awesome-javascript": { // The GitHub user and repo names
  slug: "javascript", // A slug used for short URLs (like https://list.community/javascript)
  label: "JavaScript", // The label displayed in the homepage and in the page title
  shortDescription: // Description shown in the homepage
    "JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to give functionality to web pages.",
  logo: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/tc39", // The logo, ideally a GitHub avatar so that we can pass a `size` param
  color: "#f7df1e", // Color used in the topbar
  category: "Programming Languages", // Ideally, one of the categories from https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
  invertTextColor: true, // If necessary for better readability, true will make the text in the topbar black instead of white
}
```
