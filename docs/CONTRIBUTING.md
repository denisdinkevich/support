## How do I add a list?

Please add your list [to this file](../src/lists.js) and submit a pull request. Here's an example:

```js
"sorrycc/awesome-javascript": {
  slug: "javascript",
  label: "JavaScript",
  description:
    "JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language used alongside HTML and CSS to give functionality to web pages.",
  logo: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/javascript",
  color: "#f7df1e",
  category: "Programming Languages",
},
```

The following is an explanation of the required fields:

* **owner/name**: The object key is the GitHub user and repo names of the list.
* **slug**: Used for short URLs. For eg the slug `javascript` will generate this route: https://list.community/javascript.
* **label**: Short title. Displayed in the homepage and in the page title.
* **description**: Short description. Displayed in the homepage. Preferably less than 140 characters long.
* **category**: Preferably one of the existing categories or a new one from https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome.

The following fields are optional:

* **logo**: URL to an image. Preferably a GitHub avatar such as "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/username" so that we can pass a `size` param. If not available, it can be a file from the GitHub Explore project, such as "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/master/topics/ios/ios.png". It can also be a local path to a 128x128 png file with transparent background inside the `/public/logos` folder.
* **favicon**: Local path to a 32x32 png file with transparent background inside the `/public/favicons` folder.
* **color**: 6 digit hexadecimal color code for the topbar that reflects the topic's brand. Defaults to `#ffffff`.
* **mutateContent**: Allows to manipulate the rendered content, such as hiding a table of contents.
* **mutateTOC**: Allows to manipulate the rendered table of contents in the sidebar, such as hiding an item.

## How do I provide feedback, report a bug or make a feature request?

Please open an [issue here](https://github.com/listcommunity/support/issues).
Feel free to submit pull requests too.

## How can I run and deploy my own version of the website?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can refer to the [User Guide](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)
for information on different topics, such as updating to new releases, folder structure, available scripts and others.

After installing a recent version of Node and running `npm install` you should be able to start the app by typing:

```
npm run start
```

If you want to deploy your own version of the website, you should know that the app is configured to be deployed to GitHub Pages
and uses [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) to generate pre-rendered static HTML pages for each route.
You can disable this by removing the `postbuild` script from the `package.json` file:

```diff
  ...
  "build:css": "postcss src/css/index.css -o src/index.css",
  "build:js": "react-scripts build",
- "postbuild": "react-snap",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build -o private",
  ...
```

If you want to keep this behavior (for SEO purposes and users with JavaScript disabled) you should configure a
GitHub token to avoid reaching usage limits. Visit [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
and add your token to a `.env.local` file at the root:

```
REACT_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
```

You should also update:

* The `homepage` field in the `package.json` file
* The `CNAME` file
* Your Google Analytics ID in the `src/analytics.js` file
* Carbon Ads by deleting the `src/Advertisement.js` file

If you don't want to deploy to GitHub Pages, make sure to update the `public/404.html` file accordingly,
which benefits from the [Single Page Apps for GitHub Pages](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages) project.
The reason why this is used in conjunction with our static files generated by `react-snap`
is to dynamically render any repository readme that is [passed via the URL](https://list.community/listcommunity/support).
